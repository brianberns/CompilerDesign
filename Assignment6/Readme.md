[Assignment 6: Taipan: Checking and inferring types](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs4410sp21/hw_taipan_assignment.html)

Relevant lectures and other material:

* [Lecture 11: Type Checking](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs4410sp21/lec_type-checking_notes.html)
* [Lecture 12: Type Inference](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs4410sp21/lec_type-inference_notes.html)
* [Write You a Haskell](https://web.archive.org/web/20211218201109/http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/WYAH.pdf) - Internet Archive version, since the original website seems to be permanently offline.

This is a **big** step up from Assignment 5. Type inference is quite difficult to get right, and the course materials on the topic are a bit weak.
