## Northeastern University [CS 4410/6410: Compiler Design](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs4410sp21/)

Assignments are implemented in F#, and the compiler targets .NET (rather than x64 assembly). This allows me to skip over the back-end details that aren't relevant to .NET/Roslyn.

I've linked to the 2021 version of the course, because it includes the [type inference assignment](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs4410sp21/hw_taipan_assignment.html), which is my end goal. (This assignment was skipped in the 2022 version of the course, for some reason.)
